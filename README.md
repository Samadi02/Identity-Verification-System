# Identity-Verification-System
Developed a Self-Sovereign Identity system, enabling users to control and share digital identities securely. Implemented smart contracts for identity creation, revocation, and validation. Deployed the frontend on AWS S3 with HTTPS. Used IPFS/AWS S3 for decentralized oï¬€-chain storage of credentials, ensuring data integrity and user ownership.
